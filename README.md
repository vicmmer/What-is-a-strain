# What-is-a-strain---Short-Read-Approach

Welcome to the "What is a strain" short read approach repository. 
Here, we will be showing a pipeline that begins with trimmed, raw microbial data in fastq format, and ends with creating output that is useful for diagnosing whether two samples are the same strain, providing statistical support for the likeliness of this case being so as well as density plot visuals, and a ANI threshold.
